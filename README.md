## 📂 Project Files
- `app.py` → Streamlit app code
- `food_packaging_defects.csv` → Dataset
- `requirements.txt` → Dependencies

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Loads dataset and trains a Random Forest model.
2. Shows dataset preview and model performance metrics.
3. Lets users adjust sliders to simulate packaging conditions.
4. Predicts whether the package is **Good ✅** or **Defective ⚠️**.

## ✨ Achievements
- Built with Python + Streamlit
- Deployed successfully on Streamlit Cloud
- Interactive, live web app ready for assignment submission
